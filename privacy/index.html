<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
<p>The coalition of organizations behind StopTheSpies.org takes your privacy seriously. Among our fundamental principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>We do not sell our email list. We do not share or distribute your contact information unless specifically stated so.</li>
<li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we need it.</li>
<li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for a specific organizational effort, such as delivering a message to parliament, connect you via phone to your representatives, deliver a petition or in order to communicate with you about an upcoming effort.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like many websites, StopTheSpies.org collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. StopTheSpies.org’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how StopTheSpies.org’s visitors use its website. From time to time, StopTheSpies.org may share non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate with organizations and employees of organizations that are members of the coalition, e.g., for example the number of visitors or signups during a particular period.</p>
<p>StopTheSpies.org also uses potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for the purpose of geolocating users to show appropriate actions and content. For example, if you are based in the US, we will use your IP address to show you content about pending laws in the US Congress. However, StopTheSpies.org does not store IP addresses, and would only disclose IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Certain visitors to StopTheSpies.org's websites choose to interact with StopTheSpies.org in ways that require StopTheSpies.org to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that StopTheSpies.org gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. In each case, StopTheSpies.org collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with StopTheSpies.org. StopTheSpies.org does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
<h3>Third-party services</h3>
<p>Personal Data is collected for the following purposes and may be shared with the following services:
</p><ul>
<li>Cloudflare (<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/security-policy">privacy policy</a>) - Used to serve pages via a global, distributed content delivery network.</li>
<li>Vimeo LLC, by IAC. (<a href="https://vimeo.com/privacy">privacy policy</a>) - For storing and serving any videos used on the site.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to use particular features of the site, you may be required to share your personally-identifying information with these third-party service providers for the purpose of enabling the functionality of the site.</p>
<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<p>StopTheSpies.org may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, StopTheSpies.org may monitor the number of users who've signed up for an event or who've visited a particular page on the website. StopTheSpies.org may display the agregrated statistics with members of the coalition or make them available publicly. However, StopTheSpies.org does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>StopTheSpies.org may disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to members of the coalition, contractors and affiliated organizations that need to know that information in order to process it on StopTheSpies.org’s behalf or to provide services available at StopTheSpies.org. Some of those contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using StopTheSpies.org’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.</p>
<p>StopTheSpies.org will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to to coalition members, contractors and affiliated organizations, StopTheSpies.org discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena or court order, or when StopTheSpies.org believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of StopTheSpies.org, third parties or the public at large.</p>
<p>If we are required by law to disclose the information that you have submitted, we will attempt to provide you with notice (unless we are prohibited) that a request for your information has been made in order to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will attempt to provide this notice by email, if you have given us an email address, or by postal mail if you have entered a postal address. If you do not challenge the disclosure request, we may be legally required to turn over your information.</p>
<p>StopTheSpies.org takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>

StopTheSpies.org uses cookies to help StopTheSpies.org identify and track visitors, their usage of StopTheSpies.org website, and their website access preferences. StopTheSpies.org visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using StopTheSpies.org’s websites.</p>
<h3>End of life personal data usage</h3>
<p>If the StopTheSpies.org coalition is at some point disbanded, user information will not be transferred or acquired by a third party.</p>
